# Text Editor in C Proposal

##Project Goals

The goal of our project is to create a text editor in C. The lower bound of our project is that it should ideally be able to implement all the basic features one might expect in a minimal editor, including writing text (raw input/output) and being able to view text. Our stretch goals include implementing syntax highlighting and a search feature.

##Learning Goals

Our learning goals include learning C more intimately as well as learning how exactly to build a text editor from scratch. Hopefully by the end of the project we would both be proficient at C.

##Resources

We plan to use an online guide linked from the SoftSys project resources page. We believe we won't need more resources.

##First Step

We would like to do more research into the history and the different types of editors in order to gain a better understanding of the context. Our first step to implementing our own editor is to read through first chapter of the guide and set up our environment. Next we want to enter raw mode by reading keypresses from the user and exploring how echoing works. We know this task is complete when we can successfully read keypresses and echo the input back on the shell. The next step after that is making a function for low-level keypress reading and repositioning the cursor. With this task, a few tests proving that this function and repositioning works is how we might define "done". We plan to collaborate on these first steps together (because it makes sense to start out on the same page).
