# Software Systems Project 1 Proposal

1. What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.

The goal of our project is to create a text editor in C. The lower bound of our project is that it should ideally be able to implement all the basic features one might expect in a minimal editor, including writing text (raw input/output) and being able to view text. Our stretch goals include implementing syntax highlighting and a search feature.

2. What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?

Our learning goals include learning C more intimately as well as learning how exactly to build a text editor from scratch. Hopefully by the end of the project we would both be proficient at C.

3. What do you need to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?

We plan to use an online guide linked from the SoftSys project resources page. We believe we won't need more resources.

4. What are your first steps?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you can do immediately, and identify which member of the team will do them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?

We would like to do more research into the history and the different types of editors in order to gain a better understanding of the context. Our first step to implementing our own editor is to read through first chapter of the guide and set up our environment. Next we want to enter raw mode by reading keypresses from the user and exploring how echoing works. We know this task is complete when we can successfully read keypresses and echo the input back on the shell. The next step after that is making a function for low-level keypress reading and repositioning the cursor. With this task, a few tests proving that this function and repositioning works is how we might define "done". We plan to collaborate on these first steps together (because it makes sense to start out on the same page).
